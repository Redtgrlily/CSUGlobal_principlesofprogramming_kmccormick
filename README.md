This is for my principles of programming master's course at CSU Global. 

A. Write a python program to find the addition and subtraction of two numbers. Ask for user input on two numbers (num1 and num2). Using the given numbers, add them together to find the output. Also subtract the two numbers to find the output. 
B. Write a python program to find the multiplication and division of two numbers input by a user (num1 and num2). Display the outputs.
